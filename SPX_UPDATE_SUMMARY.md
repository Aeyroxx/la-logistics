# L&A Logistic Services - SPX Pricing Update & Admin Delete Feature

## Updates Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Admin Delete Feature**
- **Backend**: Added `DELETE /api/parcels/:id` endpoint (admin-only)
- **Frontend**: Added delete buttons in the dashboard table for admin users only
- **Security**: Requires admin role verification
- **UI**: Red delete button with confirmation dialog

### 2. ✅ **Corrected SPX Pricing Logic**

#### **Previous (INCORRECT) Logic:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE - WRONG!
const baseRate = quantity <= 100 ? 0.5 : 1
const bonus = pickedUpSameDay ? 1 : 0
return (quantity * baseRate) + (quantity * bonus)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Applied different rates for 0-100 vs 100+ parcels
- ❌ Applied bonus to ALL parcels regardless of incentive cap
- ❌ No consideration of 100-parcel limit per Shop ID

#### **New (CORRECT) Logic Based on SPX Memo:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE - CORRECT!
const incentivizedParcels = Math.min(quantity, 100)
const baseRate = incentivizedParcels * 0.5      // ₱0.50 per parcel
const bonusRate = pickedUpSameDay ? incentivizedParcels * 0.5 : 0
return baseRate + bonusRate
```

**Key Corrections:**
- ✅ **Order Cap**: Only first 100 parcels per Shop ID are incentivized
- ✅ **Base Rate**: ₱0.50 per incentivized parcel (guaranteed)
- ✅ **Bonus Rate**: ₱0.50 per incentivized parcel (if same-day pickup)
- ✅ **Maximum per Shop ID**: ₱100.00 total (₱50 base + ₱50 bonus)

## SPX Pricing Examples (Corrected)

| Parcels | Picked Up Same Day | Base Rate | Bonus Rate | Total Earning |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 50      | ❌ No             | ₱25.00   | ₱0.00     | **₱25.00**   |
| 50      | ✅ Yes            | ₱25.00   | ₱25.00    | **₱50.00**   |
| 100     | ❌ No             | ₱50.00   | ₱0.00     | **₱50.00**   |
| 100     | ✅ Yes            | ₱50.00   | ₱50.00    | **₱100.00**  |
| 150     | ❌ No             | ₱50.00   | ₱0.00     | **₱50.00**   |
| 150     | ✅ Yes            | ₱50.00   | ₱50.00    | **₱100.00**  |
| 500     | ✅ Yes            | ₱50.00   | ₱50.00    | **₱100.00**  |

### **Key Insight from SPX Memo:**
> "Service Points shall only be entitled to receive both Base and Bonus Rate for the first one hundred (100) SPX Parcels received from each shop ID on a given day."

This means:
- **Parcels 1-100**: ₱0.50 base + ₱0.50 bonus (if same day) = up to ₱1.00 each
- **Parcels 101+**: ₱0.00 (no incentive payment)

## Flash Pricing (Unchanged)
- Maximum 30 parcels per Seller ID: ₱3.00 each
- No same-day pickup requirement
- Total cap: ₱90.00 per Seller ID per day

## Testing the Changes

### Test Admin Delete Feature:
1. Login as admin (`admin@lalogistics.com` / `admin123`)
2. Add some parcel entries
3. Notice "Delete" buttons in the Actions column
4. Click delete and confirm
5. Entry should be removed from database

### Test Corrected SPX Pricing:
1. Add SPX entry with 150 parcels, same-day pickup
2. Expected earning: ₱100.00 (not ₱450.00 as before)
3. Add SPX entry with 50 parcels, no same-day pickup
4. Expected earning: ₱25.00
